**MARVEL HAS BEEN WONDERFULL FOR ME , IT HAS GIVEN ME PLATFORM TO EXPRESS , EXPLORE AND EDUCATE MYSELF , SO BEFORE I BEGIN MY BLOG I WOULD LIKE TO THANK MARVEL FOR EVERYTHING IT HAS GIVEN ME üëè üëè üëè**

## WHAT I HAVE ACCOMPLISHED IN MARVEL SO FAR... ü§î, HERE IT IS üòô  

  1.**TASK NO 1 : JAVASCRIPT**   
  Learn the basics of javascript and create a small webpage which takes the names and marks of ten students and calculates the
   Percentage of each student
   Class average
   Rankings of the students
  
  2.**TASK NO 2 : Async JS**  

  Learn about asynchronous javascript and implement a small callback based program that displays the steps of a food recipe (consisting of at least 10 steps).

  3.**TASK NO 3: Promises**  
  
  Implement the above recipe program with promises and list the potential benefits and improvements of using the same
  
  4.**TASK NO 4 : GET FAMILIAR WITH THE COMMAND LINE ON UBUNTU AND DO THE FOLLOWING SUBTASK**  

  The task was to understand basic commands in ubuntu and do subtasks , but I must say ... this was one of the easiest tasks to do , my pre-learnt ubuntu commands came to help here and it was peice of cake üç∞  

  5.**TASK NO 5:  VI**  

  Learn the basics of vi and create a markdown file in vi illustrating the various features of vi that you found to be fascinating.  

  6.**TASK NO  6 :  Linux Continued**  

  Learn the basics of regex and piping in Linux. Using the knowledge gained from the above two topics, learn how grep works. Use grep to extract login times within a date/time range from the login logs using the 'last' command. Pipe this information into a text file and put it into a folder named logs. Zip this folder using gzip and tar.

  7.**TASK NO 7: Introduction to Cloud Computing** 

  Objective of the task is to get familiar with the process of setting up a local file sharing solution. At the end you should be able to share files between devices, and access shared files from different devices. Document the process along with necessary photographs. 
 
8.**TASK NO 8:  Introduction to Cybersecurity**

The objective is to introduce Crypotography . At the end you should be able to understand various ciphers and be able to decode them. Convert & document the following text into Caesar cipher, Pigpen cipher, Morse code, Rail fence cipher, Polybius cipher & Playfair cipher:
Cybersecurity in Marvel

 ### 1.**TASK NO 1 : JAVASCRIPT**    
 ---  

  i have created a website  , a website which accepts names and marks of ten students and calculate the the percentage of each student , and class average and the ranking of the students .

###  2.**TASK NO 2 : Async JS**
---

asynchronous java script includes , await and aync like functions 
async() - allows us to write promises-based code as if it was synchronous and it checks that we are not breaking the execution thread.
usually used to unwrap promises by passing a Promise as the expression

while the website looks like this

--------------
3.**TASK NO 3: Promises**  
---------------------
  
  Implementing the above recipe program with promises
  potential benefits of using promise

the benefits of using promises are

Better definition of control flow of asynchronous logic
Reduced coupling
Better error handling
Improved readability

### 4.**TASK NO 4 : GET FAMILIAR WITH THE COMMAND LINE ON UBUNTU AND DO THE FOLLOWING SUBTASK** 
--- 
Ubuntu is a Linux distribution based on Debian and composed mostly of free and open-source software. learning the basics of ubuntu commands will help in understanding the linux , some of the basic command to learn in ubuntu are . . .

```
pwd 
cd
mkdir
ls
cat
touch
... many others
```
the first sub-Task was to create 2650 folders using ubuntu , open ubuntu, change into the directory where you want to create the folders , you can do it using following command
```
cd <respective directory>
```
TO create 2650 folders , you can simply do this by following command
```
mkdir M{1..2560}
```

second sub-task was about concatenating two files , for this create 3 files named file1.txt file2.txt & file3.txt . write in file1.txt , file2.txt .  

**for concatenating these 2 files into file3.txt use the following command**  

```
cat file1.txt file2.txt > file3.txt
```

 5.**TASK NO 5:  VI**  

  some of the important short cuts are 
  ```
  $ vi <filename> ‚Äî Open or edit a file.
i ‚Äî Switch to Insert mode.
Esc ‚Äî Switch to Command mode.
:w ‚Äî Save and continue editing.
:wq or ZZ ‚Äî Save and quit/exit vi.
:q! ‚Äî Quit vi and do not save changes.
yy ‚Äî Yank (copy) a line of text.
p ‚Äî Paste a line of yanked text below the current line.
o ‚Äî Open a new line under the current line.
O ‚Äî Open a new line above the current line.
A ‚Äî Append to the end of the line.
a ‚Äî Append after the cursor‚Äôs current position.
I ‚Äî Insert text at the beginning of the current line.
  ```
